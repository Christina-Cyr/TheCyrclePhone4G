<h1>LICENSES</h1>

<p>The Cyrcle Phone 4G LTE's software (including AOSP, Linux, and F-Droid) and hardware (including schematics, board layout, and enclosure CAD files) are shared with you under open source licenses, with some limitations due to closed source licenses we have had to sign with suppliers in order to obtain specific components. Mobile phones notoriously have a plethora of open source licenses and private driver licenses to maintain, for both the hardware and software. Communicating these licenses to our users in a clear manner is important to us. </p>
