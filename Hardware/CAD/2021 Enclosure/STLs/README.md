These are the STL files for The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure.

Tips for printing:
- Calibrate your machine first. The walls are thin and will test your 3D printer's tolerances.
- Print the "back shell" separately, face down, and use rectilinear supports inside to make the back of the shell smooth. Use pliers to grab and twist the support material out from the inside of the "back shell". The inside will end up being rough, but the outside smoothness will feel nice in the hand.
- Print the "faceplate" face down on a glassy surface for a nice and smooth face. We typically use a contrasting color (black) for this piece, and consequently have to print it separately.
- Print the "outer ring" with the tabs up, face down, because you will want the face of the "outer ring" to be smooth, and allow the slight indentations for the ports to print well on top. (You can sand away any irregularities that may occur with the tabs later since they end up hidden in the design.)

History:
In July 2020, industrial designer Wesley Millora submitted an entry for The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure contest held on MyMiniFactory and won "Best Exterior" out of 64 submissions.
In September 2020, dTOOR solicited Millora for a bid to update the design for injection molding purposes, which he then submitted.
Months rolled by as dTOOR continued to work on software development.
In late December 2020, Millora was contacted by dTOOR Founder & CEO Christina Cyr, formerly asking him to join the team. Since Millora was on vacation, and working on another project at the time, Cyr also asked permission to use Millora's design in the meantime, since units needed to be submitted to China for testing by January 10th.
In short, these files were created by dTOOR Founder & CEO Christina Cyr in January 2021, specifically based on (and only after obtaining consent) Wesley Millora's images submitted for The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure design contest on MyMiniFactory, with the intention of Millora joining the team at a later date when he was available. Millora joined the team in March 2021 to update the design for injection molding purposes.
As such, these files are not absolutely identical to the final product, as they have been designed to print (more) reliably on a 3D printer (slightly thicker walls, no 3% wall incline required for injection molding, etc.). These 3D-printer-friendly files were used for all of our evaluation models. In our experience, these files can be printed fairly reliabily with most PLA filaments on most 3D printers, so that you can have any color (or sparkle) you want. These files are also provided to you so that you can enhance the design to better fit your style (rabbit ears, etc.). We would love it if you could share photos of your designs on social media and tag us at #cyrclephone so that we can see what you've added. Have fun!
