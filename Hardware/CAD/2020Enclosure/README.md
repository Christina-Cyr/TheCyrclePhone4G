These are the files dTOOR Founder & CEO Christina Cyr designed for The Cyrcle Phone 4G enclosure for The Cyrcle Phone booth at CES2020. Important note: This model accommodates the older Tequila PCB, but does not accommodate the new temperature sensor hardware near the selfie camera on the newer Mezcal PCB. We recommend widening the selfie camera housing to accommodate this change, or using the 2021enclosure. 

This model uses the following two (2) McMaster Carr threaded inserts and four (4) screws.

- Threaded inserts: Tapered Heat-Set Inserts For Plastic, Brass, M1.6 x 0.35 Mm Thread Size, 2.92 Mm Installed Length, 94180A501 https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/127/3569
- 4mm Screws: JIS Steel Flat Head Screws, M1.6 x 0.35 mm Thread, 4mm Long, 91305A003 https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/127/3293/
